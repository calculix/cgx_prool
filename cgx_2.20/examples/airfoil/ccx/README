Purpose:
This is a CalculiX-cfd example. The same model as for isaac 
will be read. But because ccx run's an inviscid calculation the mesh-density 
in the boundary-layer is reduced. In addition the model 
is sweeped from 2D to 3D. In the current state 
of ccx the achievable accuracy is only satisfying for inviscid calculations 
with an overall high mesh density. 

The results might be be compared to AGARD Report AR 138, May 1979

call cgx in the build mode.
Either for hexaeder which is slow but more accurate:
  cgx -b send.fbl
Or for pentaeders which is much faster but less accurate:
  cgx -b send_penta.fbl

call ccx with the prepared input file:

  export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4; ccx rae2822

Post-processing with:

  cgx rae2822.frd


Remark:
a restart is possible after writing velocity, temperature and pressure with:
send all abq lc<nr-of-dataset> (3 times, one for each dataset)
Then include the files in the initial conditions section and
start ccx again
